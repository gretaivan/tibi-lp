Sorry for the delay; I was checking with the security team about why I am supposed to do this interview, as I have already had a security clearance. The security team advised that the clearance was simply going through the transfer to the other organisation. 

I am unclear on the number of the requirements and would like to have them clarified. Firstly, I am unclear about what details you want based on the attachments; it would be great if you could confirm which parts must be filled out for this type of clearance. 

Secondly, there is no place to put a list of contacts in any attachments. Also, what do you define as a contact, and how far back do I need to source them out. Frankly, it feels conflicting to go to people and ask for their addresses when I barely know them. How do I justify this? Especially when I assumed that we were not supposed to talk about work. There is no problem with close friends as I know their addresses anyway.  

Finally, the details about my financial data are particularly intrusive; previously, I was asked only about the liabilities, but what you are requesting is highly detailed and was not required previously. I am surprised to see this for the SC level.

Also, following our phone call when you mentioned "Russian contacts", I am pretty confused about where this is coming from and if my mother's birth location could have been possibly related to the reasoning of this much more detailed information request, which most of the things have nothing to do with my contacts.
